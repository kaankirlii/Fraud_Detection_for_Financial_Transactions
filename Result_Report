Analysis:
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 94.8% on the test dataset, indicating that the model is generally successful. 
- The precision and recall rates for class 0 (non-fraudulent transactions) are quite high, demonstrating that the model accurately 
identifies non-fraudulent transactions without missing many. 
- Although the model struggles with identifying fraudulent transactions, it has the potential to increase the recall rate for 
class 1 (fraudulent transactions). 
- Overall, the model's ability to identify non-fraudulent transactions and its high accuracy rate are positive indicators of 
its effectiveness in fraud detection.

Next Steps:
- Improvements can be made to increase the recall rate for class 1 (fraudulent transactions) to enhance the model's ability 
to identify fraudulent transactions.
- Model tuning can be conducted to refine the model.
- Exploring and implementing different machine learning algorithms and techniques can be planned to further enhance 
the model's performance.
