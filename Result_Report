### Analysis:
- The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 94.8% on the test dataset.
- Precision for class 0 (non-fraudulent transactions) is high at 95%, indicating that the model correctly identifies non-fraudulent transactions.
- However, precision for class 1 (fraudulent transactions) is very low at 0%, indicating that the model struggles to correctly identify fraudulent transactions.
- Overall, while the model performs well in identifying non-fraudulent transactions, it needs improvement in detecting fraudulent transactions.

### Next Steps:
- Selection to improve model performance.
- Experimentation with different machine learning algorithms and parameter tuning.
- Exploration of ensemble methods or advanced techniques for better fraud detection.
